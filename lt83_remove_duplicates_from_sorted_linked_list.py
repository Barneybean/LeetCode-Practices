# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
